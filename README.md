## 📖 About The Project

Bloomin Beds is a Directed Experimental Education / Internship Project developed by Professor Harris's class at Johnson & Wales University. It is an innovative garden bed monitoring system designed to address overheating in garden beds and promote year-round gardening through its integrated ventilation system, which is controlled via software. This allows the garden beds to be utilized effectively even during winter months.

The project utilizes a Raspberry Pi board and various sensors to create a user-friendly app and website where students can monitor the health of the plants by collecting valuable data on environmental conditions and plant growth. Additionally, Bloomin Beds simplifies gardening tasks for users, making it an accessible tool for both educational purposes and practical application in agricultural settings.

### Built With

* Raspberry Pi
* Python
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Sensor Technology (Temperature, Humidity, Moisture)
* Real-time Data Visualization
